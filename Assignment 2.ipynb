    "## Monte Carlo simulation is among the most important numerical algorithms from 20th century. Its importance for financial applications stems from the fact that it is most flexible in terms of financial products that can be valued. First applied to European option pricing in 1977 by Phelim Boyle (cf. Boyle (1977)), it took until the 21st century for the problem of valuing American options by Monte Carlo simulation to be satisfactorily solved by Francis Longstaff and Eduardo Schwartz (cf. Longstaff and Schwartz (2001)) and others (cf. Chapter 7). Glasserman (2004) provides a comprehensive introduction to Monte Carlo methods for financial engineering and is a standard reference. Kohler (2009) is a survey article of regression-based valuation approaches for American options.by YVES HILPISCH(2015)"

    "## Portfolio insurance is a hedging technique which attempts to manage risk and limit losses by buying and selling financial instruments (for example, stocks or futures) in reaction to changes in market price rather than changes in market fundamentals. Specifically, they buy when the market is rising, and sell when the market is falling, without regard for any fundamental information about why the market is rising or falling. Thus it is an example of an \"informationless trade\" that has the potential to create a market-destabilizing feedback loop.\n",
    "## This strategy became a source of downward pressure when portfolio insurers whose computer models noted that stocks opened lower and continued their steep price. The models recommended even further sales.The potential for computer-generated feedback loops that these hedges created has been discussed as a factor compounding the severity of the crash.(Black Monday (1987))"
